## Introduction
The goal of this notebook is to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on the applicant's information. This project showcases:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Feature engineering for improved predictive performance
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Setup and Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to identify:
- Missing values
- Outliers
- Relationships between features

Key techniques used:
- Statistical summaries
- Correlation heatmaps
- Visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms)

## Feature Engineering
Enhance the dataset by:
- Creating new features to improve model performance
- Imputing missing values
- Handling outliers

## Encoding Categorical Variables
Convert categorical features into numeric formats using:
- One-hot encoding
- Label encoding

## Data Transformations
Standardize and normalize data to prepare it for modeling using:
- Min-Max Scaling
- Standard Scaling

## Modeling and Evaluation
Train and evaluate machine learning models:
- Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook loan_approve.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and modeling.
